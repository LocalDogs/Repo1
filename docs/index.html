        <p>Local Dogs is an Android app designed to let pet owners match their specific pet with another, based on certain criteria. We stand out apart from the competition by dedicating the app to setting up dog playdates or get-togethers. You can swipe through a queue of other pet owners, so you can find the perfect match! Once you find your perfect match, set up a playdate via the Local Dogs map. Our map contains information generated from the userbase as well as the Google Maps API, so you can locate or even tag your own dog-friendly locales!</p>
