                <li><b>Local Dogs</b> is an Android app designed to let pet owners match their pet with another user's pet, based on certain criteria.</li>
                <li>We stand out apart from the competition by dedicating the app to exclusively setting up dog playdates or get-togethers. You can swipe through a queue of other pets, so you can find the perfect match!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can filter dogs by:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Breed</b></li>
                        <li><b>Age</b></li>
                        <li><b>Weight</b></li>
                        <li><b>Activity Level</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Once you find your perfect match, use the integrated <b>Google Maps</b> and set up a playdate through contacting your match's owner!</li><br>
